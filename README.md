# enigma_final_project
Reflecting back I struggled with this project a lot. I've felt very unmotivated while working on this project due to a lack of confidence with the overall MOD. 
I've come to find what I need to work on and have decided upon this project that I should repeat Mod 1 as a way to solidify my foundation in Ruby. 
I know what I need to practice and put more focus in. I also have seen what I am strong at and would like to strengthen those areas as well.
