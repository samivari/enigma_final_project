# Functionality - 3
The Enigma class has a functioning encrypt and and decrypt method. The command line interfaces are also successful taking in a text file, encrypting the message as well as decrypting the encryption.

# OOP - 3 
The project is broken into logical portions. No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about.

# Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 4 
Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. No methods are longer than 10 lines long. Most enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job. 

# TDD - 4 
Unfortunately no mocks or stubs were used but I was able to work around that and effectively test random generated numbers. I also found TimeCop on stackoverflow which allowed to "freeze" time. And Simplecov returned to 100%. My tests are robust and explicit.

# Version Control - 4
I have 40 commits and commented on most PR as a form of self review. I created a branch for every class and broke it up into logical chunks.
