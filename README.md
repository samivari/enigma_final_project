# enigma_final_project
Reflecting back I struggled with this project a lot. I've felt very unmotivated while working on this project due to a lack of confidence with the overall MOD. 
I've come to find what I need to work on and have decided upon this project that I should repeat Mod 1 as a way to solidify my foundation in Ruby. 
I know what I need to practice and put more focus in. I also have seen what I am strong at and would like to strengthen those areas as well. I'm not proud of my work in this project and know what went wrong. I wont allow myself to fall into this hole of self doubt again. I know what needs to change and how much harder I need to work for this. 
This project taught me the changes that need to be made in order to have sucess in Turing as well as haveing sucess after Turing.
